** What is Event Propagation ?

>> Event Propagation determines in which order the elements receive the event.
>> There are two ways to handle this event propagation order of HTML DOM is 
Event Bubbling and Event Capturing.

>> byDefault it is Event Bubbling.


***************************************************************************************************************
** Bubbling -->

>> When an event happens on an element, it first runs the handlers on it,
then on its parent, then all the way up on other ancestors.

** stopping bubbling -->

>> if an element has multiple event handlers on the single event, then even if one of them stops the 
bubbling, the other ones still execute.

>> there is a method event.stopImmediatePropagation().

***************************************************************************************************************


** Capture Phase -->

>> Going from the window to the event target phase the events is 
first captured by the outermost element and propagated to the inner elements
>> capturing is also called "trickling"

*********************************************************************************************************


** Target Phase -->

>> the event reached the target element.

*********************************************************************************************************


** Higher Order Function --->

>> which takes another function as an arguments.

>> wo function jo dusre function ko as an argument accept krta h.


** CallBack Function --->

>> which get passed as an argument to another function .

>> jis bhi function ko hum kisi or function ke under as an arguments passed krte h 
than usko hum callback function kaihte h.

>> In other words; a variable can be used before it has been declared.

will be by looking at the code.

>> Lexical Scoping means now, the inner function can get access to their parent functions variables

** What is Closures in JS ?

>> A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its 
surrounding state (the lexical environment).

>> In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer function's scope from an inner function.

>> closers are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.

What is Event Loop in JS ?

>> Javascript engine has two parts, Heap and Call Stack. And the engine has some assistant named Web APIs and Callback Queue.

** HEAPS -->

>> It's an unstructured memory block. Our code's memory allocation happens here. 

** CALL STACK -->

>> We can consider Call Stack as a kitchen where all our code executed or cooked. Whenever we try to run 
a piece of code, it goes to call stack first and then executed. It works in LIFO style. That is Last In 
First Out.

/*

>> If we run the code above, The global execution context main() runs on the browser, and JS engine will 

start to read the code from the first line and will search for tasks. On the last line, one function is 

called. So, this function will go to the Call Stack and will execute the tasks. First it will print, 

(Time to breakfast!) 
then goes to the next line, where we have an asynchronous block of code.

>> As we know, JavaScript is synchronous and single-threaded language, this asynchronous block of code goes to the call stack and suddenly pops out. Here JS engine takes help from it's assistant, Web API.  

>> The setTimeout() waits on the Web API and after it's timer runs out (In this case, 3 seconds), After 3 seconds the callback function goes to the Callback Queue and waits for Call stack to be free. By this 
time, Call stack runs the other piece of codes. Prints

(It's time for dinner!)

** WEB APIs -->

>> Web API works as JS engines assistant. When JS engine have to deal with asynchronous code, it takes 

the help of Web API. Web API handles the blocking behavior of JavaScript code.

In this case, from our code above, we can say Web API will take the callback function

(setTimeout(lunch, 3000);)

, run it's timer, and pass it to Callback Queue after 3 seconds.

** CALLBACK QUEUE -->

>> It's a guard who monitors the stack of asynchronous callback functions who just completed the task of 

waiting and passed the gate of Web API. Callback Queue works using FIFO (First In First Out ) method. 

And now, they waits here to go back to Call Stack. But how will Call Stack know that there's some 

callback functions waiting in Callback Queue?

Here comes the star, Event Loop!

** EVENT LOOP -->

>> Event loop is just a guardian who keeps a good communication with Call Stack and Callback Queue. It 

checks if the call stack is free, then lets know the callback queue. Then Callback queue passes the 

callback function to Call stack to be executed. When all the callback functions are executed, the call 

stack is out and global execution context is free.

** Function Currying -->

>> Currying is a technique of evaluating function with multiple arguments, into sequence of function with single argument.

EX:- sum(5)(3)(8);

<< it takes the first one and returns a new function, which takes the second one and returns a new function, which takes the third one, and so on, until all arguments are  completed.
