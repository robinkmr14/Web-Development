>> HTML events are "things" that happens to HTML elements.
>> when JavaScript is used in HTML pages, JavaScript can "react" on these events.
>> HTML events can be something the browser does, or something a user does.
>> JavaScript lets you execute code when events are detected.


** there are 4 ways of writing Events in JS...
        1.  using inline events alert();
        2.  By calling a Function
        3.  using inline events (HTML onclick="" property and element.onclick)
        4.  using events listeners (addEventListener and IE's attachEvent)

** What is Event Object? 
>> the "event" object represents an occurrence or interaction within the browser window,
such as a mouse click, keyboard input, or a page load.It contains information about the 
event itself and provides properties and methods to access and manipulate that information.



** MouseEvent in JS
>> The MouseEvent occur when the mouse interacts with the HTML document.


** KeyboardEvent in JS
>> Events that occur when user presses a key on the keyboard


** InputEvents in JS
>> The onchange event occurs when the value of an element has been changed.

>> For radiobuttons and checkboxes, the onchange event occurs when the checked state has been changed.





** JAVASCRIPT TIMING EVENTS

>> The window object allows execution of code at specified time intervals.

>> These time intervals are called timing events.

>> The two key methods use with JavaScript are:

-> setTimeout(function, milliseconds)-> executes a function,after waiting a specified num of milliseconds.

->setInterval(function,milliseconds)->same as setTimeout(),but the execution of the function continuously.

** We have four methods

>> setTimeout()

>> clearTimeout()

>> setInterval()

>> clearInterval()
